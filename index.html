Schwab.</p> <p>THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED... The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise. WHO WILL CRUMBLE? Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving Antari - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive? WHO WILL RISE? Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the Night Spire collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible. WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL? And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</p> </div> </div> </section> <section id=gallery> <div class="grid-main-area slider"> <div class=text> <div class=controls> <img src=../images/back-arrow.svg alt="Left arrow" class=left-arrow> <img src=../images/right-arrow.svg alt="Right arrow" class=right-arrow> </div> <header> <div id=slider-text-content> <p id=slider-subtitle class=separator>Memories</p> <h2 id=slider-title>Meeting Gallery</h2> <p id=slider-text> Make new friends and memories while you read some awesome books.

Schwab</p> <p>The book club will rate this book after our meeting in January 12th 2019. Visit our Facebook page for more details!</p> <p>Synopsis: It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London. Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port. And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall. </p> </div> <div class=container> <figure> <img src=../images/aDarkerShadeOfMagic.jpg alt="Image of the book we read in November." height=375px> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <div class=rating> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> </div> <p class=bookTitle>November 2018: "A Darker Shade of Magic" by V.E. Schwab</p> <p>The book club rated this book 5 out of 5 stars. We loved the story so much we are continuing on with the next two books in the series!</p> <p>Synopsis: Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black. Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see. Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive. </p> </div> <div class=container> <figure> <img src=../images/OctoberBook.JPG alt="Image of the book we read in October." height=375px> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <div class=rating> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/star.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/Emptystar.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/Emptystar.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> <img src=../images/Emptystar.svg height=40px alt="star icon"> </div> <p class=bookTitle>October 2018: "Rosemary's Baby" by Ira Levin</p> <p>The book club rated this book 2 out of 5 stars.

Really good storyline and it keeps the reader engaged. A real page turner! </p> <p>Synopsis: Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. </p> </div> </div> </div></section> <section id=contact> <div class="grid social"> <div class=container> <p class=title>Contact Us</p> <a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/1787101514664278/ class=btn>Facebook</a> <a href="mailto: mildred.brito@outlook.com" class=btn>Mail</a> </div> </div> </section> <script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/javascript/bundle.js"></script></body> </html>
